        Hello, my name is Vatsal Dani
        ! I'm a first-year Computer Information Systems student at Mount Royal University, navigating the intriguing world of technology and information. When I'm not buried in code or exploring the latest tech trends, you'll find me passionately following my favorite sports teams. Whether it's cheering for the Mets at the crack of a bat, celebrating a touchdown by the Patriots, or rallying behind the Raptors as they score a basket, 
        sports bring a thrill to my life that nothing else can. But that's not all I'm about. I have a deep appreciation for cinema, finding joy in the stories and artistry movies offer. And when the screen dims, I love to step outside, embracing the simple pleasures of the outdoors. Whether it's a quiet walk or an adventurous hike, being in nature is where I find my balance.
